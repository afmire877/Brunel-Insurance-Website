			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>Brunel Insurance Services is totally independent and we are able to shop around a wide range of insurers in order to bring you the very best insurance policy at the right price. A lot of the big household insurance names tend to be direct insurance writers, which means they have only their own insurance policies to sell so they are often restricted in the band of insurance risk they will insure. As we have over 25 insurers in which to choose from, it means we have far more flexibility in placing an insurance risk, even if your circumstances are unusual e.g. several claims and convictions.</p>

			<p>Brunel, we believe our service should go beyond merely arranging client’s insurance protection. Our aim is to provide whatever advice, explanation and guidance is required to ensure our clients are entirely satisfied and fully understand their insurance arrangements, whilst providing ongoing assistance with all insurance administration.</p>

			<p>All of our staff are experienced insurance professionals who have decades of experience between them. Brunel aim to provide you with not only the cheapest insurance policy around, but also we ensure that you have the right insurance cover for your own individual circumstances. Brunel is purely based in the UK with our offices based in London and Slough. Brunel offer professional Insurance advice. When you pick up the phone to us, you speak to a person not "scripted telesales operators".</p>

			<p>The success of the company has been founded upon providing a complete insurance service with professionalism whilst maintaining that all-important personal touch, a tradition we aim to uphold at Brunel.</p>

			<p>We have every confidence that Brunel Insurance Services will exceed your expectations of an insurance broker and we look forward to welcoming you as a client very soon. If we can be of any further assistance, please call us on 020 8579 1786 or send us an email
